            - If the user says there is no paint, glue etc on the window then don't ask the next question that you want us to remove it etc.
            - Before you ask do you want us to remove paint, glass etc and user replies with yes or maybe etc or doesn't specify what is on the glass then ask the user that what is on the glass?
            - if user replies to the question of "Any Paint, Glue, Caulk, Concrete, etc.. on the glass ?" on the glass with i don't know. maybe, i don't think so etc then reply with: "If paint, glue, concrete, etc is not noticeable on glass,
            we recommend let us clean the glass, take note of what remains, so next time we can remove it as we clean windows. Overall this is the most affordable plan" and move to the next question.
